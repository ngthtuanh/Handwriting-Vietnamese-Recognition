# Handwriting-Vietnamese-Recognition
1. Introduction <br>
1.1 Problem definition <br>
The handwriting recognition project aims to develop a system that can recognize and convert handwritten Vietnamese text into digital text. In todayâ€™s world, the digitalization of information is crucial, particularly in fields such as education, healthcare, finance, and public administration. Handwriting, while still widely used in everyday communication, presents challenges for information processing and retrieval when it exists in physical or image formats. The problem of handwriting recognition is not only about simplifying the conversion process but also plays an important role in improving work efficiency and minimizing human errors. In real-world applications, handwriting recognition technology can be used to automate processes such as scanning physical documents, entering data into systems, or supporting smart devices, saving time and boosting productivity. With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, handwriting recognition is becoming increasingly accurate and efficient, opening up many practical application opportunities, from supporting office work to solutions in healthcare and education. <br>
1.2 What is Input/Output? <br>
- In our project, the input consists of images containing handwritten Vietnamese text, while the output is a digital text representation of the handwritten input. 
- Input include handwritten Vietnamese text in the form of lines, written in standard handwriting (without support for complex styles such as calligraphy or highly stylized characters).
- Output can be a plain text or formatted text version of the input, including punctuation and line breaks where necessary

2. Dataset <br>
For data exploration, the project uses the HANDS-VNOnDB2018 data set, commonly referred to as VNOnDB2018, which was used in the ICFHR2018 Competition on Vietnamese Online Handwritten Text Recognition. This dataset includes 1,146 linebreak handwritten Vietnamese paragraphs, comprising 7,296 lines, over 480,000 strokes, and more than 380,000 characters written by 200
Vietnamese individuals. The dataset is structured into three main folders: lnkData_word, lnkData_paragragh, and lnkData_line, each corresponding to different levels of granularity in handwritten text. In addition, the corresponding CSV files contain relevant labels, ensuring an organized framework for recognizing handwritten words, lines, and entire paragraphs. <br>
